          We’ve been working with Active Bridge since August 2015.
          In the first six months, our application (marketplace in the sports industry)
          was built and launched with a team of 3 developers and a technical lead.
          The whole team were very responsive, organized and have great communication skills.
          Best of all, they were very proactive in suggesting improvements or pointing out potential issues in our plans –
          which we really appreciate as we don’t have an in-house technical team.
          After the active development phase, we’ve retained Active Bridge for the ongoing development and maintenance
          of our platform and I couldn’t recommend them enough.
