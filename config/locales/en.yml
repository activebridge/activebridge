          We initially engaged with Active Bridge in 2014 while re-structuring our product and engineering team.
          More than two years later, we're still engaged to augment our engineering team.
          They bring excellent Agile and TDD software development practices to our team and are effective and efficient collaborators.
          They are very experienced running software projects, but equally proficient in adapting to our internal processes.
          We consider the engineers assigned to our company a core part of the team.
          Thanks guys!

          We worked with Active Bridge as a young startup to build out our first MVP and subsequent updated products.
          Not only did their teams execute on the assigned tasks ahead of schedule, but they also contributed to our thinking around UX,
          asking probing questions and suggesting added features that we had not thought about.
          Overall this is an absolutely amazing team to work with, composed of driven developers and bright minds.
          We feel so incredibly lucky to be working with them

          We’ve been working with Active Bridge since August 2015.
          In the first six months, our application (marketplace in the sports industry)
          was built and launched with a team of 3 developers and a technical lead.
          The whole team were very responsive, organized and have great communication skills.
          Best of all, they were very proactive in suggesting improvements or pointing out potential issues in our plans –
          which we really appreciate as we don’t have an in-house technical team.
          After the active development phase, we’ve retained Active Bridge for the ongoing development and maintenance
          of our platform and I couldn’t recommend them enough.

          After previously hiring contract developers in countries ranging from the US and Canada, to Vietnam and India,
          and after having paid variously three times more and three times less per hour, we finally got it right when
          we found Active-Bridge. Their staff are as competent and productive as the three times more expensive people,
          and deliver more code per dollar than the three times less expensive people.
          There’s no better source for best quality, best practice and best value development services than
          Active-Bridge. We’re delighted and most appreciative. Thank you.
