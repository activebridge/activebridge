          We worked with Active Bridge as a young startup to build out our first MVP and subsequent updated products.
          Not only did their teams execute on the assigned tasks ahead of schedule, but they also contributed to our thinking around UX,
          asking probing questions and suggesting added features that we had not thought about.
          Overall this is an absolutely amazing team to work with, composed of driven developers and bright minds.
          We feel so incredibly lucky to be working with them

          We’ve been working with Active Bridge since August 2015.
          In the first six months, our application (marketplace in the sports industry)
          was built and launched with a team of 3 developers and a technical lead.
          The whole team were very responsive, organized and have great communication skills.
          Best of all, they were very proactive in suggesting improvements or pointing out potential issues in our plans –
          which we really appreciate as we don’t have an in-house technical team.
          After the active development phase, we’ve retained Active Bridge for the ongoing development and maintenance
          of our platform and I couldn’t recommend them enough.

          After previously hiring contract developers in countries ranging from the US and Canada, to Vietnam and India,
          and after having paid variously three times more and three times less per hour, we finally got it right when
          we found Active-Bridge. Their staff are as competent and productive as the three times more expensive people,
          and deliver more code per dollar than the three times less expensive people.
          There’s no better source for best quality, best practice and best value development services than
          Active-Bridge. We’re delighted and most appreciative. Thank you.

  about_us: 
    information:
      first: Active Bridge is an IT contracting company that specializes in providing dedicated full-stack developers 
             to help our clients and augment their in-house teams. Since 2013, our offshore IT staffing agency has been 
             assisting clients in the development and maintenance of websites and web-based systems, mobile applications, 
             and software products.
      second: Active Bridge started out as a small team of Ukrainian developers passionate about Ruby on Rails programming
              and providing effective web solutions for our clients in the United States and Europe. Today, our company has
              grown to include a staff of talented and experienced tech professionals with over 20 successful major projects 
              under our belt. 
      third: Our team has worked with startups, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and large corporations in both 
             North America and Eastern Europe. Our goal is always to prioritize the needs of our customers, and we strive to 
             build and maintain trust and productive relationships with all of our partners. That customer-centered focus is 
             why Active Bridge was named one of the “Top B2B Service Providers, 2017” by Clutch.co., and why we’re consistently 
             rated as one of the top web and software developers in Eastern Europe.
